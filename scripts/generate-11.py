The weight of some operations is charged using the same quantity that the assets pallet benchmarks \
have computed. However, other operations only charge the weight of one runtime database read \
operation â€” T::DbWeight::get().reads(1_u64).\n\
Two functions, MetadataSymbol and MetadataName, operate on a variable amount of data, but they \
also only account for one runtime database read operation.",
