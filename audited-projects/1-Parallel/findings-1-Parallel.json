Users can avoid accruing interest by repaying a zero amount\nSeverity: Medium\nDifficulty: Low\nType: Data Validation\nFinding ID: TOB-PLF-2\nTarget: pallets/loans/src/lib.rs\nDescription\nTo repay borrowed funds, users call the repay_borrow extrinsic. The extrinsic implementation calls the Pallet::repay_borrow_internal method to recompute the loan balance. Pallet::repay_borrow_internal updates the loan balance for the account and resets the borrow index as part of the calculation.\nfn repay_borrow_internal(\nborrower: &T::AccountId,\nasset_id: AssetIdOf<T>,\naccount_borrows: BalanceOf<T>,\nrepay_amount: BalanceOf<T>,\n) -> DispatchResult {\n// ... <redacted>\nAccountBorrows::<T>::insert(\nasset_id,\nborrower,\nBorrowSnapshot {\nprincipal: account_borrows_new,\nborrow_index: Self::borrow_index(asset_id),\n},\n);\nTotalBorrows::<T>::insert(asset_id, total_borrows_new);\nOk(())\n}\nFigure 2.1: pallets/loans/src/lib.rs:1057-1087\nThe borrow index is used in the calculation of the accumulated interest for the loan in Pallet::current_balance_from_snapshot. Specifically, the outstanding balance, snapshot.principal, is multiplied by the quotient of borrow_index divided by snapshot.borrow_index.\npub fn current_balance_from_snapshot(\nasset_id: AssetIdOf<T>,\nsnapshot: BorrowSnapshot<BalanceOf<T>>,\n) -> Result<BalanceOf<T>, DispatchError> {\nif snapshot.principal.is_zero() || snapshot.borrow_index.is_zero() {\nreturn Ok(Zero::zero());\n}\n// Calculate new borrow balance using the interest index:\n// recent_borrow_balance = snapshot.principal * borrow_index /\n// snapshot.borrow_index\nlet recent_borrow_balance = Self::borrow_index(asset_id)\n.checked_div(&snapshot.borrow_index)\n.and_then(|r| r.checked_mul_int(snapshot.principal))\n.ok_or(ArithmeticError::Overflow)?;\nOk(recent_borrow_balance)\n}\nFigure 2.2: pallets/loans/src/lib.rs:1106-1121\nTherefore, if the snapshot borrow index is updated to Self::borrow_index(asset_id), the resulting recent_borrow_balance in Pallet::current_balance_from_snapshot will always be equal to snapshot.principal. That is, no interest will be applied to the loan. It follows that the accrued interest is lost whenever part of the loan is repaid. In an extreme case, if the repaid amount passed to repay_borrow is 0, users could reset the borrow index without repaying anything.\nThe same issue is present in the implementations of the liquidated_transfer and borrow extrinsics as well.\nExploit Scenario\nA malicious user borrows assets from Parallel Finance and calls repay_borrow with a repay_amount of zero. This allows her to avoid paying interest on the loan.\nRecommendations\nShort term, modify the code so that the accrued interest is added to the snapshot principal when the snapshot is updated.\nLong term, add unit tests for edge cases (like repaying a zero amount) to increase the chances of discovering unexpected system behavior.",

Missing validation in multiple StakingLedger methods\nSeverity: Undetermined\nDifficulty: High\nType: Data Validation\nFinding ID: TOB-PLF-4\nTarget: pallets/liquid-staking/src/types.rs\nDescription\nThe staking ledger is used to keep track of the total amount of staked funds in the system. It is updated in response to cross-consensus messaging (XCM) requests to the parent chain (either Polkadot or Kusama). A number of the StakingLedger methods lack sufficient input validation before they update the staking ledger’s internal state. Even though the input is validated as part of the original XCM call, there could still be issues due to implementation errors or overlooked corner cases.\nFirst, the StakingLedger::rebond method does not use checked arithmetic to update the active balance. The method should also check that the computed unlocking_balance is equal to the input value at the end of the loop to ensure that the system remains consistent.\npub fn rebond(&mut self, value: Balance) {\nlet mut unlocking_balance: Balance = Zero::zero();\nwhile let Some(last) = self.unlocking.last_mut() {\nif unlocking_balance + last.value <= value {\nunlocking_balance += last.value;\nself.active += last.value;\nself.unlocking.pop();\n} else {\nlet diff = value - unlocking_balance;\nunlocking_balance += diff;\nself.active += diff;\nlast.value -= diff;\n}\nif unlocking_balance >= value {\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\nFigure 4.1: pallets/liquid-staking/src/types.rs:199-219\nSecond, the StakingLedger::bond_extra method does not use checked arithmetic to update the total and active balances.\npub fn bond_extra(&mut self, value: Balance) {\nself.total += value;\nself.active += value;\n}\nFigure 4.2: pallets/liquid-staking/src/types.rs:223-226\nFinally, the StakingLedger::unbond method does not use checked arithmetic when updating the active balance.\npub fn unbond(&mut self, value: Balance, target_era: EraIndex) {\nif let Some(mut chunk) = self\n.unlocking\n.last_mut()\n.filter(|chunk| chunk.era == target_era)\n{\nchunk.value = chunk.value.saturating_add(value);\n} else {\nself.unlocking.push(UnlockChunk {\nvalue,\nera: target_era,\n});\n};\nself.active -= value;\n}\nFigure 4.3: pallets/liquid-staking/src/types.rs:230-253\nSince the staking ledger is updated by a number of the XCM response handlers, and XCM responses may return out of order, it is important to ensure that input to the staking ledger methods is validated to prevent issues due to race conditions and corner cases.\nWe could not find a way to exploit this issue, but we cannot rule out the risk that it could be used to cause a denial-of-service condition in the system.\nExploit Scenario\nThe staking ledger's state is updated as part of a WithdrawUnbonded request, leaving the unlocking vector in the staking ledger empty. Later, when the response to a previous call to rebond is handled, the ledger is updated again, which leaves it in an inconsistent state.\nRecommendations\nShort term, ensure that the balance represented by the staking ledger’s unlocking vector is enough to cover the input balance passed to StakingLedger::rebond. Use checked arithmetic in all staking ledger methods that update the ledger’s internal state to ensure that issues due to data races are detected and handled correctly.",

The close, reopen, and auction_succeeded extrinsics have virtually identical logic. The migrate_pending and refund extrinsics are also fairly similar.\nExploit Scenario\nA vulnerability is found in the duplicate code, but it is patched in only one place.\nRecommendations\nShort term, refactor the close, reopen, and auction_succeeded extrinsics into one function, to be called with values specific to the extrinsics. Refactor common pieces of logic in the migrate_pending and refund extrinsics.\nLong term, avoid code duplication, as it makes the system harder to review and update.
