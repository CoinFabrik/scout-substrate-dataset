      "description": "All the assets pallet functions exposed by the chain extension are weighted with a constant amount. The weight of some operations is charged using the same quantity that the assets pallet benchmarks have computed. However, other operations only charge the weight of one runtime database read operation \u2014 T::DbWeight::get().reads(1_u64).\nTwo functions, MetadataSymbol and MetadataName, operate on a variable amount of data, but they also only account for one runtime database read operation.",
      "description_summary": "Constant weight for functions, ignores variable data in MetadataSymbol & MetadataName."
